### _Bridging the gap between complex libraries and developer implementation._

## 📌 Philosophy

# 

I believe an SDK is only as powerful as its documentation. My approach focuses on **Time-to-First-Call (TTFC)**—reducing the minutes it takes for a developer to go from `npm install` to a successful API response. I focus on:

*   **Discoverability:** Making methods and properties easy to find.
    
*   **Predictability:** Consistent naming conventions and error handling.
    
*   **Contextual Examples:** Providing real-world code snippets, not just abstract syntax.
    

* * *

## 🚀 All SDK Projects worked

1. Enhance README and fix strict type imports: https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/docs/pull/106
2. Add comprehensive sdk methods reference for issue: https://github.com/prince0xdev/mailzeet-ts/pull/9
3. Add streaming, error handling, and config examples: https://github.com/micah-nettey/layer-ai/pull/90
4. SDK documentation - JavaScript: https://github.com/abm-dev-git/kong-portal/pull/138
5. SDK documentation - Python: https://github.com/abm-dev-git/kong-portal/pull/139

## 🛠 My SDK Documentation "Talent Stack"

# 

I utilize a **Docs-as-Code** workflow to ensure documentation scales with the software:

*   **Standards:** OpenAPI/Swagger for spec-driven documentation.
    
*   **Environments:** GitHub Codespaces & Postman for live testing.
